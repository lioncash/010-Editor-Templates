# 010 Templates

### What is this repo for?

It contains template definitions I use with 010 Editor.
They're used to define the layouts of data structures and file formats to make examining binaries less annoying and tedious.

### Hi, I really care about licensing for trivial things. What license is everything in this repo under?

Public domain.
